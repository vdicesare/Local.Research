Abstract:
In this research article we propose a theoretical and empirical framework of local research, a concept of growing importance due to its far-reaching implications for public policy. Our motivation stems from the lack of clarity surrounding the increasing yet uncritical use of the term in both scientific publications and policy documents, where local research is conceptualized and measured in many ways. A clear understanding of it is crucial for informed decision-making when setting research agendas, allocating funds, and evaluating and rewarding scientists. Our twofold aim is (1) to compare the existing approaches that define and measure local research, and (2) to assess the implications of applying one over another. We first review the perspectives and measures used since the 1970s. Drawing on spatial scientometrics and proximities, we then build a framework that splits the concept into several dimensions: locally informed research, locally situated research, locally relevant research, locally bound research, and locally governed research. Each dimension is composed of a definition and a methodological approach, which we test in 10 million publications from the Dimensions database. Our findings reveal that these approaches measure distinct and sometimes unaligned aspects of local research, with varying effectiveness across countries and disciplines. This study highlights the complex, multifaceted nature of local research. We provide a flexible framework that facilitates the analysis of these dimensions and their intersections, in an attempt to contribute to the understanding and assessment of local research and its role within the production, dissemination, and impact of scientific knowledge.
